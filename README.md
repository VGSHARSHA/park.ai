near them using the app.

## Why park.ai?

1) On any given working day approximately 40% of the roads in urban India are taken up for just parking the cars. 
2) Tremendous pressure on parking spaces have led to serious concerns like traffic congestion, accidents, disproportionate demand and supply ratio, environmental hazards etc.
3) Pollutants like oil and grease are washed off from the parking lots into the water bodies during the rains. The pollutants contaminate the water table and are also responsible for urban heat island effect. The pollutants it emits causes health hazards and may cause respiratory and cardiovascular damages.

Guess what? It removes all the above and many more!
